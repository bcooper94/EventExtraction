Call For Papers – ERA Track
The 24th edition of the International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER’17) will feature an Early Research Achievements (ERA) track.

The goal of the ERA track is to provide researchers and practitioners with a forum for presenting promising ideas in early stages of research. These ideas do not require a strong empirical evaluation. The 2017 ERA track aims to provide constructive feedback to guide authors from their initial ideas and limited evaluations toward solid SANER 2018 papers with strong empirical underpinnings. The ERA track is specifically looking for fresh, innovative, provocative ideas. We aim to create an open atmosphere where discussion and feedback stands central.

The topics of interest for the ERA track are the same as the main research track and concern all the topics in the research and practice of software analysis, evolution, and reengineering.

Evaluation Criteria:

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, potential impact, technical soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Emphasis will be put on the originality and timeliness of the proposed contribution; a full evaluation of the proposed ideas is not required.

Submission instructions:

Papers must not exceed five pages (including all text, figures, references, and appendices)
Papers must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines
Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the SANER 2017 EasyChair submission site
Submissions that do not comply with the instructions and size limits may be desk rejected without review.

Papers submitted to the ERA must not have been previously accepted for publication or submitted for review to another publication venue.
