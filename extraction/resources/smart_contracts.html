1st Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts

In Assocation with Financial Cryptography 17

The Palace Hotel & Spa

Overview

A potentially highly transformational technology currently developing on top of blockchain technologies are smart contracts, i.e. self-enforcing agreements in the form of executable programs that are deployed to and run on top of (specialised) blockchains. A prominent example, also in terms of capitalisation and market share, is the Ethereum blockchain. It has a Turing-complete programming model, and bears one of the most striking performed attacks, the DAO attack (not to mention the discussed fork adopted as a counter measure).

These technologies introduce a novel programming framework and execution environment, which are not satisfactory understood at the moment. Multidisciplinary and multifactorial aspects affect correctness, safety, privacy, authentication, efficiency, sustainability, resilience and trust in smart contracts. Existing frameworks, which are competing for their market share, adopt different solutions to issues like the above ones. Merits of proposed solutions are still to be fully evaluated and compared by means of systematic scientific investigation, and further research is needed towards laying the foundations of Trusted Smart Contracts.

The Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts (TWSC) aims to gather together researchers from both academia and industry interested in the many facets of Trusted Smart Contract engineering, and to provide a multi-disciplinary forum for discussing open problems, proposed solutions and the vision on future developments. Experts in fields including (but not limited to!) programming languages, verification, security, decision and game theory, cryptography, monetary systems, finance, and economics, as well as pratictioners and companies interested in block chain technologies, are invited to take part in this first edtion of WTSC and make it a lively forum.
